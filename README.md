# What do you feel like listening to?

## Motivation
- I love music. There are also times where I don't love music. The latter happens when I just can't seem to find the *right* song to fit my mood. 
What does the *right* song sound like? Does it even exist? Will it come up next? The only way I can know is if I *feel* it. I wanted to find *that* song with the help of machine learning. 
Before finding that song, we need to discover which songs evoke which emotions.
